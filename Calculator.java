/*3.Write a class with the name Calculator. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name 
floor of type Floor and carpet of type Carpet.

The class needs to have one constructor with parameters floor of type Floor and carpet of type Carpet
 and it needs to initialize the fields.  

Write the following methods (instance methods):  

Method named getTotalCost without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated total cost to 
cover the floor with a carpet.
TEST EXAMPLE   TEST CODE:  

Carpet carpet = new Carpet(3.5);

Floor floor = new Floor(2.75, 4.0);

Calculator calculator = new Calculator(floor, carpet);

System.out.println("total= " + calculator.getTotalCost());

carpet = new Carpet(1.5); floor = new Floor(5.4, 4.5);

calculator = new Calculator(floor, carpet);

System.out.println("total= " + calculator.getTotalCost());  

OUTPUT  

total= 38.5

total= 36.45 */
